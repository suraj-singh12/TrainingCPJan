finish this, and you can reach 1900


# Sorting 
Fast: O(nlogn)  eg. merge/ heap
Slow: O(n^2)    eg. insertion/ bubble sort etc


space : const eg. (bubble)
        space taking : eg. mergesort

Stability of sorting algorithm:
if you have two elements, and if both have same value, then their relative order should be preserved.
This is the stability of sorting algorithm.
If order is not preserved, the algorithm is unstable.

Eg. Bubble sort is a stable algorithm
sorting will be asked (write the code for this algorithm)

Total no of swaps while doing sorting ?
maintain a counter

selection sort
no of passes in sorting (in all algos)
